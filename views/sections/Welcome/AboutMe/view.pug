        | In highschool I participated in a couple notable clubs one of these was
        a(href= "https://www.uscyberpatriot.org") CyberPatriot
        | , In which me and my team were able succeed at computer security. We made it to the top 12 national teams for the open division 2 years in a row. From this, I have experience with the security and operation of many linux, and some windows security practices, as well as security practices for common applications on those platforms.

        | Another club I participated in was
        a(href= "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc") FIRST Robotics Competition
        | .
        |  I was a member, and later a leader of, the software team. For a couple of those years my team would use National Instrument's LabVIEW as our code for the robot, but as we became more ambitious and tried to integrate the vision api, we realized that LabVIEW was not suited towards such intensive operation. We therefore switched to using Java as our language of choice as it provided more power as well as flexibility as we could more easily offload and onload data over the network in order to take advantage of a Raspberry Pi co-processor.
