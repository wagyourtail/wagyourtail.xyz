    h2 Discord Moderation Bot.
    p#description WagYourBot is a modular Discord bot written in TypeScript. I created it in order to enhance the moderation and automation of certain functions of my and my friends Discord server's, since then I have been asked to add features to it in order to facilitate some more automation and fun tasks. It has also grown as the bot is public and more users add it to their servers. I re-coded the bot when I decided to make a website in order to use a proper database instead of JSON files for storing user/server data. The development of a plugin is fairly straightforward and allows for flexibility. Coding this bot improved my abilities with Node.js and Typescript and I've become proficient with async data and other modern JavaScript features. This was also my first exposure to Redis and MySQL as I am now using MariaDB as the database, this database has a non-sql structure.
